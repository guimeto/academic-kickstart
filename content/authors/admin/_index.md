I am able to discuss and negotiate with scientists/analysts from different backgrounds in order to understand their needs and offer them the best solution and more importantly develop tools that are unanimously accepted. I worked in various environments, ranging in the development of extreme weather indices (droughts, extreme precipitation...), validation of regional climate models, development of epidemiological indices, monitoring of vector disease, analysis of storm trajectories or work on instrumental data.
I am interested by Open Science and willing to learn about Data Science.
